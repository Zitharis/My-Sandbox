# A Simple Animation

For my first challenge, I just wanted to code a simple animation that changes and creates a sort of loading screen in the user's console. I chose to do this in JS with setInterval as I've used it before and I already had the entire project mapped out in my mind.
This took me just under an hour and was a fun little idea that I think I'll optimize and expand on more. I might even use this concept in some of my other projects!
